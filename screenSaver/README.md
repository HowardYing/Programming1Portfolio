# Screen Saver
![alt text](https://howardying.github.io/Programming1Portfolio/Images/screenSaver1.png)

This is a basic screen saver application that draws random line trails on a black background. The line trails form square and polygonal designs. When a trail travels offscreen, it is replaced in a random location. After a duration of time, the screen saver will reset, erasing all line trails, but preserving the location of their "heads". This allows for some unique designs to form over time. The goal of this project was to explore applications of "for" loops and random number generation.

# Code
![alt text](https://howardying.github.io/Programming1Portfolio/Images/screenSaver2.png)

This screen saver application was made using Processing 3. Two classes were used in this app. The Line class handled the display and travelling behavior of the lines. The main class handled the window size and determined the number of line trails to include. About 85 lines of code were used in total.
