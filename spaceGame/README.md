This is a basic shooter game set in space, similar to those found on retro consoles. The premise is to defend earth from an alien attack, and shoot down missiles that are heading down, towards the planet. After a set amount of time, the game ends and a score is represented as an efficiency ratio. Currently, there is no penalty for letting missiles hit the planet.

This game was made using Processing 3. It consists of three classes. The Bullet class handles the generation and hit detection of the bullets. The Spaceship class displays the spaceship and the shoot animation. The main class handles the game logic, game timer, and HUD. About 150 lines of code were used in total.
