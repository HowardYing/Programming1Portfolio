This is a simple calculator application that can perform the four basic operations and find squares and square roots. Additionally, it can calculate the sine, cosine, and tangent of angles. Decimals and negative numbers are, of course, supported. Pressing the equals sign after an operation is completed will repeat the operation on the result. The aesthetics of this app are inspired by the calculator built into the Windows 10 Operating System.
