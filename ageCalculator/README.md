This is a basic age calculator that uses the current date and an inputted birth date. This was developed as an exploration into the usage and function of the datetime module. The goal was to become familiarized with the different formats that date & time can be represented in Python. The entire program is executed in the command line; there is no GUI.

This calculator application was made using Python 3. The application calculates the age by converting the inputted birthdate into seconds since the epoch. The current date is also converted to the same format. The two values are then subtracted, and the resulting number is converted back into a date tuple. The tuple is then sliced and outputted. About 14 lines of code were used.
