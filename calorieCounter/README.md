# Group Project: Calorie Counter
![alt text](https://howardying.github.io/Programming1Portfolio/Images/calorieCounter1.png)

This application is a calorie counter and management tool. During inital setup, the application asks for basic physiological information from the user. It is then run through a model, and recommendations of daily calorie intakes are given to maintain or lower the current weight. The application also includes a daily calorie logger with a recall function that persists between sessions.

This distance converter was made using Processing 3, in Python Mode. This was split among three different group members.  Tyler Herron developed a skeleton GUI interface. Addison Richey developed the calorie calculation model, continued development of the GUI, as well as the external save and load function. Howard Ying (me) developed the button class (responsible for the behavior of the radio buttons), as well as a data packing and unpacking class to simplify the save process.
